# **Statistical Analysis of Prostate Cancer Mortality (2010, Zacatecas)**

## **Central Tendency Measures**

### **Mode**
The mode of prostate cancer mortality rates in 2010 is **3.1314%**, indicating that this percentage was the most frequently observed value across all age groups.

### **Mean**
The mean percentage of deaths due to prostate cancer in 2010 is **12.5%**. This suggests that, on average, **12.5% of total deaths** recorded in the dataset were attributed to malignant prostate cancer across all age groups.

### **Median**
The median mortality percentage is **12.77%**, meaning that **half of the observations** in the dataset fall below this percentage, while the other half are above it. In a dataset consisting of **94 recorded deaths**, this implies that for 50% of the groups, the mortality rate was lower than **12.77%**, while the other half had rates exceeding this value.

## **Dispersion Measures**

### **Variance and Standard Deviation**
- The variance of the data is **68.22%**, indicating a moderate spread of the death percentages around the mean (**12.5%**).
- The standard deviation (**SD**) is **8.26%**, suggesting moderate variation in mortality rates across different groups. Most values fall within **4.24% to 20.76%** (i.e., one standard deviation from the mean), showing the diversity in mortality rates across age groups or regions in Zacatecas.

### **Coefficient of Variation (CV)**
The **coefficient of variation (CV) is 66.08%**, suggesting a high relative variability in prostate cancer mortality rates across different groups in Zacatecas. This indicates that the mortality rates are **not consistent** across regions or age groups.

### **Skewness**
A **skewness of 0.15** indicates that the distribution of death percentages is approximately symmetric but has a **slight positive skew**, meaning a few age groups or regions had **slightly higher** mortality rates. However, the difference is **not substantial**.

## **Test for Normality**
Since the **p-value (0.2348) is greater than 0.05**, we **fail to reject the null hypothesis** of the Shapiro-Wilk test. This means there is no significant evidence to suggest that the data is not normally distributed.

### **Conclusion**
Based on the statistical analysis, we conclude that the dataset follows an **approximately normal distribution**, with a **moderate spread** in prostate cancer mortality rates across different age groups or regions in Zacatecas in 2010. The **high CV** highlights significant variability in mortality rates across groups, while the **slightly positive skewness** suggests some regions or age groups had marginally higher mortality rates than others.




# **Statistical Analysis of Prostate Cancer Mortality (2011, Zacatecas)**

## **Central Tendency Measures**

### **Mode**
The mode of prostate cancer mortality rates in 2011 is **15.73%**, indicating that this percentage was the most frequently observed value across all age groups in Zacatecas.

### **Mean**
The mean percentage of deaths due to prostate cancer in 2011 is **12.5%**. This suggests that, on average, **12.5% of total deaths** recorded in the dataset were attributed to malignant prostate cancer across all age groups.

### **Median**
The median mortality percentage is **12.92%**, meaning that **half of the observations** in the dataset fall below this percentage, while the other half are above it. This implies that 50% of the groups had a mortality rate lower than **12.92%**, while the other half had rates exceeding this value.

## **Dispersion Measures**

### **Variance and Standard Deviation**
- The variance of the data is **12.96%**, indicating a **low to moderate spread** in the mortality percentages around the mean (**12.5%**).
- The standard deviation (**SD**) is **3.6%**, suggesting a **low to moderate variation** in mortality rates across different groups. Most values fall within **8.9% to 16.1%** (i.e., one standard deviation from the mean), showing that the diversity in mortality rates is **not very high** compared to the previous year.

### **Coefficient of Variation (CV)**
The **coefficient of variation (CV) is 28.8%**, indicating **low to moderate relative variability** in prostate cancer mortality rates across different groups in Zacatecas. This suggests that the mortality rates in **2011 were more stable** compared to **2010**.

### **Skewness**
A **skewness of 0.65** indicates that the distribution of death percentages has a **moderate positive skew**, meaning that some regions or age groups had **higher-than-average** mortality rates. However, the difference is **not extreme**.

## **Test for Normality**
Since the **p-value is greater than 0.05**, we **fail to reject the null hypothesis** of the Shapiro-Wilk test. This suggests that there is **no significant evidence** to indicate that the data deviates from a normal distribution, meaning we can assume the data is approximately **normally distributed**.

# **Statistical Analysis of Prostate Cancer Mortality (2021, Zacatecas)**

## **Central Tendency Measures**

### **Mode**
The mode of prostate cancer mortality rates in 2021 is **0.72%**, representing the most frequently observed percentage of deaths due to malignant prostate cancer across all age groups in Zacatecas.

### **Mean**
The mean percentage of deaths due to prostate cancer in 2021 is **12.5%**. This suggests that, on average, **12.5% of total deaths** recorded in the dataset were attributed to malignant prostate cancer across all age groups.

### **Median**
The median mortality percentage is **10.58%**, meaning that **half of the observations** in the dataset fall below this percentage, while the other half are above it. This implies that 50% of the groups had a mortality rate lower than **10.58%**, while the other half had rates exceeding this value.

## **Dispersion Measures**

### **Standard Deviation**
- The standard deviation (**SD**) is **10.96%**, suggesting a **high variation** in mortality rates across different groups. Most values fall within **1.54% to 23.46%** (i.e., one standard deviation from the mean), indicating a **substantial diversity** in mortality measurements across different age groups or regions.

### **Coefficient of Variation (CV)**
The **coefficient of variation (CV) is 87.68%**, indicating **high relative variability** in prostate cancer mortality rates across different groups in Zacatecas. This suggests that the mortality rates in **2021 were highly dispersed**.

### **Skewness**
A **skewness of 0.48** indicates that the distribution of death percentages has a **small right tail**, meaning that some regions or age groups had **slightly higher-than-average** mortality rates. However, the difference is **not substantial**.

## **Test for Normality**
Since the **p-value is greater than 0.05**, we **fail to reject the null hypothesis** of the Shapiro-Wilk test. This suggests that there is **no significant evidence** to indicate that the data deviates from a normal distribution, meaning we can assume the data is approximately **normally distributed**.
